title: "Duo & You: Exploring Status In Duolingo's Design"

subtitle: "Duolingo has the difficult task of making learning language fun. Through the rapid gamification though, how much of Duolingo becomes learning the language versus looking good in the eyes of others?"

Nothing scares me more in this world than wasps.

A close second though? Probably someone with a triple digit Duolingo streak.

_Duolingo loves to remind you how dedicated you are to learning. But just how much quality learning is being done here?_

To those who are not one of the 130 million monthly active users Duolingo has, the application touts a "gamified" approach to learning languages that makes the daunting idea a bit more approachable. Users walk a linear path to language mastery through bite-sized lessons every day, building up a streak day after day to keep the loveable (yet sadistic) mascot, Duo, happy.

It has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2012, where its sole goal was to lower the barrier to entry to education and bring a free way for people to learn another language. However, while Duolingo continues to pull [PR stunt after PR stunt](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/duolingo-experimenting-with-silence-amid-social-media-blackout/), I wanted to put Duolingo's core mechanic under the limelight: streaks. Once an extremely useful system to keep you motivated to learn, it has warped over time into something far more reflective of yourself...for better or for worse.

Like the clothes you wear or the car you drive, Duolingo streaks for people have become a status symbol. And it starts to call into question whether education is truly at its heart.

## Prestige in Your Palms

If you have used Duolingo recently and began your journey into learning a language, you've probably been met with a bright and flashy prompt after a few days of learning.

_A flashy animation and a warm splash of color turns your one minute lesson into a monumental achievement._

This is Duolingo's exclusive and prestigious club of learners known as the **Streak Society**. When it first launched in 2022, you were inducted into this group after reaching a year of consistent studying with Duolingo. Themed after the flame iconography their streaks take after, as well as leveraging the phoenix as a well-known icon across cultures, it serves as a universally acknowledgeable milestone of your committed learning.

Being in an in-group ([a term used to describe a group of people you identify with](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/social-sciences-and-humanities/ingroups-and-outgroups)) is not a new concept, and it leads to a myriad of positive benefits for a user's self-esteem. The establishment of the Streak Society helps bolster your self-esteem by reaffirming what you believe about yourself; by being in a group of disciplined, high achieving language learners, you too feel like you are disciplined and high achieving. An in-group also helps clarify what you are _not_, as a clearly defined out-group gives you a point of comparison for your own achievements.

This is perfect for Duolingo, because a user that believes they have those qualities will continue to engage with the application, and down the line may even pay for their [increasingly prominent premium options](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/). They wouldn't dare try to break their streak, because if they did, they would lose a central part of their identity as a Duolingo user, and in turn, a central part about themselves as a learner.

This is the crux of what makes in-groups powerful tools in persuasive design. Behavior is governed by how people wish to be seen. If a user wishes to be seen as a person who is on a journey to learn a language, then Duolingo benefits by providing that recognition to them.

Now, others know that you are part of a larger community, whether it's by word of mouth, or its through an [icon next to your name on a leaderboard](), [special app icon only for Streak Society members](), or a [widget plastered on your home screen](). It provides a clear distinction between a Duolingo user and a _successful_ Duolingo user, which is what everyone wants to be perceived as.

However, there is a large hurdle to this issue: a year is a _long_ time to wait to reap the benefits of the Streak Society. The average user retention rate [drops to a meager 8%](https://onesignal.com/mobile-app-benchmarks-2024) after one month, so the competition to keep their user's attention is fierce.

Thankfully for Duolingo, a subtle change to how the Streak Society works (alongside a few additional features) allows more people into the in-group faster _without_ degrading the quality of the group itself.

## Spreading Like Wildfire

Duolingo's solution to keeping user's invested is clever, but simple: quietly reduce the 365 day streak requirement from 365 days to 7 days. Now, you're inducted into this "prestigious" club only after a week of consistency, versus a whole year.

Keep in mind that no design indicators have changed because of this; users still receive the elaborate animation, positive message, and the rewards that come with the club (although they are spread out a bit more). There is still a badge by their name, the phoenix motifs are still present on the widget, etc.

The status is still perceived as "exclusive" and "rigorous", but the standards are lowered to where users receive that self-esteem boost earlier in their usage, rather than waiting for the payoff a year later.

This is perfect for Duolingo, as now instead of having to fight an 8% or worse retention rate, the average _7-day_ retention rate is a [much more generous 18%](https://onesignal.com/mobile-app-benchmarks-2024). Users are also satisfied since they get access to to all the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the Streak Society, without feeling like the status was degraded with the bar being lowered.

Furthermore, the push to establish a user early on via streaks and the Streak Society is complimented by just _how easy_ it is to keep a streak.

Streak Freezes, for example, help preserve streaks should learners forget to do their lessons that day, which is an amazing idea on paper. We all live busy lives, and a safety net helps ensure that our hard earned progress doesn't go to waste is always appreciated. However, with the frequency at which Streak Freezes can be purchased (or even as rewards for lessons), streaks can be maintained for months and months on end without logging in as often. Streak Freezes also don't count against the streak, so to others, it appears as though the streak if a perfect one; a symbol of a flawless, dedicated learner.

_Users can view their calendar to see how many days they've skipped, but other users can only see the number._

And should a streak get broken despite every guard rail, Duolingo is generous enough to even offer a _Streak Repair_, should you be willing to sit through a few short lessons to get it back.

All of these efforts are to ensure that the streak stays alive. It becomes not a metric of your progress, but a metric of _you_, and how consistent _you_ are. The double-edged sword of streaks comes in the form of how tightly people cling to them once they pass a certain threshold. Loss aversion is the bias users experience in which the pain of losing something is a stronger influence than gaining something new. As the streak grows larger, so too does the perceived loss should a user break a streak.

This fear bypasses logic and appeals to emotion, which is the core of persuasive design. Logically, the streak is not an indicator of your language learning process. Users are learning a language piece by piece regardless of how many days they show up in a row. However, when emotions begin to cloud a user's judgement, the tendency to take the path of least resistance grows stronger.

And when Duolingo presents these easy options to maintain the streak _without_ the negative effects of not being in the in-group, it becomes easier to let the true educational purpose of Duolingo take a backseat, and reap the benefits of a free status symbol.

## Is This Still About Learning?

I do want to take the time to acknowledge though that when used responsibly, these can be *great* systems that allow users to develop desirable habits in their daily lives. Streaks is not an unfamiliar concept, and when applied to a basic goal (such as learning languages or exercising), it adds [structure and a goal beyond a simple task (maintaining the streak)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-keeping-a-streak-boosts-your-motivation/).

If Duolingo didn't work for people, it wouldn't be as popular as it is now.

However, it's also important to note that Duolingo's design is [intentionally geared towards maximizing user retention](https://youtu.be/9KqrnBiyBQ8?t=142). Streaks, and the community that comes with it, are one piece of the puzzle that comes with ensuring active users remain active and become more likely to pay for premium services. 

They have expertly accounted for both of the pain points in designing streaks: rewarding users earlier in the streak to keep it novel and exciting, and making the higher streaks easier to maintain to continue inflating its value. In short, it's become something of a spectacle: bright, bold, popular, and hard to look away from.

With those qualities though, it's easy to find it becoming a replacement over a user's sole reason for starting: learning a language. The appearance itself becomes a reward, but when it does, the process can begin to lose its luster. Does the joy from opening Duolingo come from building a streak so all can see the progress? Or is it from deepening your knowledge in a language and their culture?

It can be both. But as Duolingo continues to hit the headlines with their newest marketing tricks, there is still a tricky balance between designing for engagement and designing for enrichment. 

It's a challenge *all* mobile UI/UX developers will have to face as the digital space continues to broaden, but perhaps Duolingo already has a winning formula up their feathered sleeves.
