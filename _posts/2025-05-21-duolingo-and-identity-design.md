title:  "Duo & You: Exploring Status In Duolingo's Design"

subtitle: "Duolingo has the difficult task of making learning language fun. Through the rapid gamification though, how much of Duolingo becomes learning the language versus looking good in the eyes of others?"

Nothing scares me more in this world than wasps.

A close second though? Probably someone with a triple digit Duolingo streak.

*Duolingo loves to remind you how dedicated you are to learning. But just how much quality learning is being done here?*

To those who are not one of the 130 million monthly active users Duolingo has, the application touts a "gamified" approach to learning languages that makes the daunting idea a bit more approachable. Users walk a linear path to language mastery through bite-sized lessons every day, building up a streak day after day to keep the loveable (yet sadistic) mascot, Duo, happy.

It has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2012, where its sole goal was to lower the barrier to entry to education and bring a free way for people to learn another language. However, while Duolingo continues to pull [PR stunt after PR stunt](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/duolingo-experimenting-with-silence-amid-social-media-blackout/), I wanted to put Duolingo's core mechanic under the limelight: streaks. Once an extremely useful system to keep you motivated to learn, it has warped over time into something far more reflective of yourself...for better or for worse.

Like the clothes you wear or the car you drive, Duolingo streaks for people have become a status symbol. And it starts to call into question whether education is truly at its heart.

## Prestige in Your Palms

If you have used Duolingo recently and began your journey into learning a language, you've probably been met with a bright and flashy prompt after a few days of learning.

*A flashy animation and a warm splash of color turns your one minute lesson into a monumental achievement.*

This is Duolingo's exclusive and prestigious club of learners known as the **Streak Society**. When it first launched in 2022, you were inducted into this group after reaching a year of consistent studying with Duolingo. Themed after flame iconography their streaks take after, as well as the phoenix being a well-known icon across cultures, it serves as a universally acknowledgeable milestone of your committed learning. 

Being in an in-group (a term used to describe a group of people you identify with) is not a new concept, and it leads to a myriad of positive benefits for a user's self-esteem. The establishment of the Streak Society helps reaffirm what you believe about yourself; by being in a group of disciplined, high achieving language learners, you too feel like you are disciplined and high achieving. An in-group also helps clarify what you are *not*, as a clearly defined out-group gives you a point of comparison for your own achievements.

This is perfect for Duolingo, because a user that believes they have those qualities will continue to engage with the application, and down the line may even pay for their [increasingly prominent premium options](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/). They wouldn't dare try to break their streak, because if they did, they would lose a central part of their identity as a Duolingo user, and in turn, a central part about themselves as a learner.

However, there is a large hurdle to this issue: how do you keep a user invested for a whole year to reap the benefits of being in the in-group?

Duolingo's solution is clever, but simple: Quietly reduce the 365 day streak requirement from 365 to only 7 days. Now, you're inducted into this "prestigious" club only after a week of consistency, versus a whole year. Keep in mind that no design indicators have changed because of this. You still receive the elaborate animation, positive message, and the rewards that come with the club (although they are spread out a bit more).
