It's no secret that Duolingo is the de facto application to learn languages. Ever since its founding in 2011, it's garnered nearly 110 million active users, all of whom completed more than 13 billion exercises per week. Apple in 2013 would later choose Duolingo be the iPhone "App of the Year," which was a first for an educational application.

Today, you simply can't mention learning a language without someone suggesting to try it on Duolingo. I've tried it multiple times in the past, from learning Spanish to even Chinese. I've grinded the leaderboards, I've touted my super long streaks, I even used the app while it still had the tree-esque design for their learning paths.

With all of the memes, [ice skating performances](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjYkOqHr5aLAxUaMdAFHTWFMUEQ78AJegQIChAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlEFRl6Lej_0&usg=AOvVaw16SUuc8lDKYLxId_0VN3Q4&opi=89978449), and even their own [taco restaurant](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjflfjfr5aLAxX6MtAFHYYnDe0QFnoECDoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.duos-pgh.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2nL0aOUuVzWfyX1FaRjvdb&opi=89978449), it's hard to not equate the marketing presence with a successful program.  

And it certainly is one. Studies have shown that there is visible improvement (just take a look at Duolingo's [handy webpage that denotes all of its accolades](https://www.duolingo.com/efficacy/studies)) for those who use Duolingo. 

Peer behind the smoke and mirrors that is marketing, however, and you will find that Duolingo is an absolute masterclass at keeping users hooked on the illusion of progress. The Wall Street Journal detailed a bit about Duolingo's rigorous design process [in this video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiJsqb8tJaLAxWIMNAFHUqnBnEQwqsBegQICBAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9KqrnBiyBQ8&usg=AOvVaw3WozYKBxUmTUWdWb1VbgGS&opi=89978449), which initially inspired this blog post. This is still a business after all; as idealistic as it is to continue to provide a stellar free language learning experience, there has to be an avenue for revenue.

As such, in this lies the critical question that Duolingo continues to research. 

**How do you create an addicting experience from an innately dull subject matter?**

There are a myriad of features that Duolingo has implemented over the years that is designed to capture your attention on and off the app. Some are very subtle, others are far more blatant, but all rely on leveraging its innocuous design to make it hard to _stop_. Though it will not be the last time I discuss Duolingo (my love-hate relationship cannot be summed up in one post), I want to discuss the one feature that best represents the power gamification has on tedious topics.

And it's probably the one you, and your fellow prideful Duolingo users, are far too familiar with.

# Streaks & You

In an ideal environment, where you are passionate about what you are studying, you wouldn't need a counter that determines how many times you've spent time learning. It'd serve a moot point; you already love what you're doing, what do you benefit from a flashy number saying you've practiced for months straight?

*Would I be studying for the love of knowledge? Or just to see a nice fire icon behind my streak? Maybe a little of both?*

I am going to assume though that language learning _isn't_ a passion for most people though. At best, it's a lofty ideal that would amazing to have, but the daunting process and the tedium of learning keeps it in our dreams. Combine this with our tendency as users to take the path of least resistance, and the concept of spending any time out of our busy lives to learn a language seems to be impossible.

In order for Duolingo to work, there has to be _some_ other engaging aspect that can cover for when our interest wanes in the real reason we're here. Otherwise, Duolingo ends up in the trash can.

Enter streaks.

Streaks are, by design, made to keep users artificially engaged to return to whatever application, website, or business is supplying this streak. It's the physical representation of progress and your building momentum, as well as your commitment to whatever you are engaging with. As that number ticks higher and higher, so does your perceived notion of effort. A streak makes it clear to others that you have paid your dues and put in the work to make your goals a reality.

How we behave is how we desire to be seen. We wish to be seen as disciplined, or that we are life-long learners. The power of one's self-image is a strong driver for why social media is so popular; comparison and competition are the fuel for our desire for likes, followers, and fame. 

Duolingo knows this. Duolingo knows that a high streak is a symbol of an intelligent, dedicated individual, which is why they do everything in their power to keep you holding your precious streak. It's a perfect metric for them to leverage in order to keep you coming back. Your Duolingo streak becomes evidence for others to judge you on your capability, and *god forbid you look incapable to others*.
