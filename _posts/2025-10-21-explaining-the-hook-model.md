subtitle: "The first few days a user has an application are the most critical. In a world where attention is fleeting, priming the user to respond to triggers kicks off the vital feedback loop that keeps users conditioned and invested."

Have you ever noticed just how little applications like Instagram, Twitter (or X, I guess), or TikTok run TV ads?

Maybe it is the fact that I don't watch much cable television or stream many shows nowadays, but I have always found it weird that these wildly popular apps don't need to be advertised directly to people to be extremely successful. Large billboards are sparse, they aren't popping up in a mobile game ad anytime soon, and yet the millions of users seem to have gotten invested on their own. 

In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that some of these users can become _addicted_ to these applications; their addiction fueled without additional advertising telling them to use it.

This is not unintentional.

[Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com/about-nir-eyal) within the world of UX and "behavioral design" is a pioneer when it comes to understanding what makes users return. With thousands of distractions running rampant in our digital era, the objective for any company is to carve out a slice of time in their user's life until it becomes habitual for them. Once it's habitual, the value of the product increases, and it becomes harder to separate from their daily lives.

With this in mind, Nir created the _Hooked Model_, pictured below. Backed by a mixture of psychology, technology, and a dash of neuroscience, the model details a surefire way to create habits in a user.

_This model places extra emphasis on the reusability of this process; it can be infinitely applied to users to build stronger habits._

Describing all the steps here in detail may be a bit of a drag, so I'm taking the liberty of splitting each step into its own article. As such, let's start with where every habit begins: the subtle cue that tells your brain that it's time to act (or more appropriately, *react*).

## Feeling the Itch

As much as we'd like to think that we have rational reasons for opening apps when we do, there is often a feeling that precedes it. Maybe it's boredom. Maybe it's stress, happiness, curiosity, or even loneliness. Whatever it is, there is an itch that the application solves before you even click it. These are known as _internal triggers_, and are where the Hooked Model truly begins.

Before any push notification, before any alert, there is intrinsic motivation that comes from within the user.

The model phrases the question as "What does the user _really_ want?", since that is what the eventual _external_ triggers should be designed around. Take the all too familiar notification bubble that most applications leverage nowadays.

_More formally known as a badge, these pesky red bubbles are experts at drawing attention and invoking the need to get rid of them._

An easy way to decipher the intention of a trigger to ask "How does this trigger make me feel?" The design behind this red bubble is ingenious, due to it leveraging two innate cognitive biases that invoke a near compulsion to act: [salience bias](https://uxmag.com/articles/salience-the-psychology-of-an-experience-you-cant-ignore), which describes how users tend to focus on noteworthy information and discard the rest, and [mere urgency bias](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/45/3/673/4847790), which describes the tendency to act on unimportant tasks due to their illusion of urgency.

[One study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9246170) confirms this: the physical appearance of the bubble pulls attention from other applications that could interest the user, and the alarming color (commonly associated with _urgent_ danger) serves to inflate the importance of this notification. The result is an unconscious itch to check the app, or an almost need to get rid of that notification bubble; both internal triggers spurred by the external one.

As Janet Choi outlines in [her article on Nir's website](https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-trigger-product-usage-that-sticks), these internal triggers can not be ignored. Nobody is purely motivated by external triggers alone, rather, it is what they can get out of an application that matters most to them. A relief from boredom, some social interaction, or even just the want to remove that stubborn red bubble; these are the desires that users come with when interacting with an application, and can not be ignored when t'hey try to satisfy those desires.

// Outline
- Acknowledge the oddity that apps don't run a lot of advertising but have dozens of users.
- Introduce the Nir Eyal model. Broad overview, but eventually narrow in on the trigger portion.
- Detail internal triggers. "What does the user really want?"
- Detail external triggers. "What gets the user to the product."'
- Segway into the next article about Action.
