subtitle: "The first few days a user has an application are the most critical. In a world where attention is fleeting, priming the user to respond to triggers kicks off the vital feedback loop that keeps users conditioned and invested."

Have you ever noticed just how _little_ applications like Instagram, Twitter (or X, I guess), or TikTok run TV ads?

Maybe it is the fact that I don't watch much cable television or stream many shows nowadays, but I have always found it weird that these wildly popular apps don't need to be advertised directly to people to be extremely successful. Large billboards are sparse, they aren't popping up in a mobile game ad anytime soon, and yet the millions of users seem to have gotten invested on their own. 

In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that some of these users can become _addicted_ to these applications; their addiction fueled without the means of additional advertising telling them to use it.

This is not unintentional.

[Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com/about-nir-eyal) within the world of UX and "behavioral design" is a pioneer when it comes to understanding what makes users return. With thousands of distractions running rampant in our digital era, the objective for any company is to carve out a slice of time in their user's life until it becomes habitual for them. Once it's habitual, the value of the product increases, and it becomes harder to separate from their daily lives.

With a mixture of psychology, technology, and a dash of neuroscience, Nir created the _Hooked Model_, which serves as a surefire way to create habits within a user.

_This model places extra emphasis on the reusability of this process; it can be infinitely applied to users to build stronger habits._

Describing all the steps here in detail may be a bit of a drag, so I'm taking the liberty of splitting each step into its own article. As such, let's start with where every habit begins: the subtle cue that tells your brain that it's time to act (or more appropriately, *react*).

## Prestige in Your Palms

// Outline
- Acknowledge the oddity that apps don't run a lot of advertising but have dozens of users.
- Introduce the Nir Eyal model. Broad overview, but eventually narrow in on the trigger portion.
- Detail internal triggers. "What does the user really want?"
- Detail external triggers. "What gets the user to the product."'
- Segway into the next article about Action.
