## "If the product is free, then you are the product."

*Hooks & Loops* is a UX blog that explores the how and why to persuasive digital design. It's designed to shed light on the psychological tactics that fuel designs, as well as to explain why applications, websites, and more have us coming back again and again.

I started this blog in 2025 to supplement my interest in psychology and interaction design. I aim to combine research, real-world examples, and my own takes on design to inform those who want to peek a bit behind the curtain and see how companies win your attention.

Attention is currency. Knowledge is power. And if you know how these tactics and design decisions influence you, you can get back the time you spend towards what matters to you.

### Who Am I?

I'm John Scharff, a UI/UX developer with a passion for social psychology. After graduating with my bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Florida, I went on to do frontend development for Southern Glazers Wine & Spirits under their prestigious Next-Gen ETP program.

I aspire to work in a career where I can leverage my dual disciplines in technology and psychology to create cutting-edge products that put users and their needs first.
